# Build All #
Build all is a simple editor script for Unity 4.x that allows you to build multiple targets at once.

It also allows you to publish built projects to a folder.

This was designed with Ludum Dare in mind where you want to build your project and have it ready to use with as little down time as possible.

## Requirements ##
To run this package you must have a pro version of unity.

## How To Use ##
Simply download the [BuildAll.unitypackage](https://github.com/wiltaylor/buildall/releases/tag/Release_2) file and import it into your project.

Then Select File>BuildAll>Settings to configure your build settings.

Once configured you can use BuildAll>Build and BuildAll>Publish to do as their names suggest.

To change other build settings like scenses etc use their respective native unity settings panels.
